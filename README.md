# LendingClubCaseStudy
**Objective of the Analysis:**

The core business challenge is to ensure financial stability by minimizing credit loss. Credit loss primarily occurs when borrowers default on their loans. 

Our primary objective is to identify patterns and characteristics of borrowers that indicate a high likelihood of loan default. By spotting these patterns early, the Lending Club can take proactive measures - either denying high-risk loans or adjusting loan terms to mitigate potential losses.

Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we aim to uncover the main driver variables that have a strong relationship with the likelihood of default. This knowledge is crucial for the Lending Club's risk and portfolio assessment.

**Analysis Workflow:**
**Step 1:** Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Handling missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
Feature extraction and transformation for better insights.
**Step 2:** Univariate Analysis
Understanding individual variables and their distribution.
Identifying key patterns related to loan default in isolated features.
**Step 3:** Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis
Exploring relationships between multiple variables.
Uncovering deeper insights related to the interplay of features and loan default rates.
**Step 4:** Other Insights and trend identification
Understanding other deeper areas of the data
Understanding the trend of defaults over time.
Identifying any seasonality or specific periods with higher defaults.
**Step 5:** Conclusions and Business Recommendations
Summarizing key findings from the analysis.
Offering actionable insights to the Lending Club for better decision-making.
